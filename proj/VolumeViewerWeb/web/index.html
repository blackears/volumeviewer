                        I wrote this because I thought it would be a fun
                        project and to demonstrate the use of some of
                        the more advanced OpenGL features.
                    </p>


                    <h3>How it works:</h3>
                    <!--
                    <p>The Volume Viewer first must build a volume of data
                        in memory that describes the object to view.  It
                        does this by reading a stack of images.  Each
                        2D image is black-and-white, with the lightness of
                        each pixel representing the denseness of the
                        model at that point.  As more images are read,
                        they're placed one upon the other in a stack.  In
                        this way, a full 3D volume can be aquired.
                    </p>
                    -->

                    <p>
                        The Volume Viewer gets its data by reading
                        in a stack of images.  It then generates a stack of
                        slices that face half way between the viewer
                        and the light source (this is to allow both the
                        viewer and the light to have a good view of them).
                        Next, it renders each slice one at a time from
                        the one closest to the light to the one furthest
                        from it.  Each time, it keeps track of the shadow
                        cast by the previous layer so that it can be
                        used when drawing the next layer.  When all
                        planes are drawn, a realistic shadowed image
                        remains.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The user can influence the rendering by changing
                        the color or position of the light, and also by
                        painting on a 'transfer function' that gives
                        color to different densities in the model.
                    </p>
